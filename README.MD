## Exciting projects I made !
- <b>[TimeFinder](https://github.com/CadeJAlmond/TimeFinder)</b> <br>This project is a website meant to help with time-management. You can create events and assign a <br> date to such events. Events can be organized into groups. These events will be displayed to a calendar <br> where you can filter the calendar by groups of events. The tech stack : MySQL, NodeJs, React, Redux 
- <b>[Global Terrorism in the 21st Century](https://github.com/CadeJAlmond/Final-Project-CS-5630)</b> <br> This website displays several visualizations of terrorism globally. As well, you can find more specific <br> statistical analysis of data from specific regions of the world.
- <b>[Basic EDA Are Utahans that bad at driving?](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zDtWOrUN2-hYGn9TZ9gtQGf4XjNB6Gzv?usp=sharing)</b> <br> While this project itself is not extremely impressive, this particular notebook was an assignment from <br>a class named Data Wrangling DS 2500. This assignment here was noticed by the professor and sent <br>to every student in the class as what the ideal submission should look like for future assignments.
